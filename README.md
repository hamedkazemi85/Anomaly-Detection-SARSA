# Anomaly-Detection-SARSA
Reinforcement Learning-based anomaly detection using SARSA with discrete state encoding and a custom detection environment.
This repository contains the implementation of an anomaly detection framework based on the SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm. 
The environment simulates anomaly detection tasks using threshold-level observations, and the agent learns an optimal stopping policy 
to detect anomalies in time-series data.

Features:
- Custom detection environment built with Gym
- SARSA training with ε-greedy policy
- Pre-trained Q-tables for immediate use
- Option to retrain with custom datasets
- Example datasets for reproducibility
